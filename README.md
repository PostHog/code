# Twig

This is the monorepo for PostHog's Twig apps and the agent framework that powers them.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10.23.0

### Setup

```bash
# Install pnpm if you haven't already
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies for all packages
pnpm install

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
```

### Running in Development

```bash
# Run both agent (watch mode) and twig app in parallel
pnpm dev

# Or run them separately:
pnpm dev:agent  # Run agent in watch mode
pnpm dev:twig   # Run twig app
```

> **Want to connect to a local PostHog instance?** See [docs/LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT.md) for OAuth setup and connecting to localhost:8010.

### Utility Scripts

Scripts in `scripts/` for development and debugging:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scripts/clean-twig-macos.sh` | Remove all Twig app data from macOS (caches, preferences, logs, saved state). Use `--app` flag to also delete Twig.app from /Applications. |
| `scripts/test-access-token.js` | Validate a PostHog OAuth access token by testing API endpoints. Usage: `node scripts/test-access-token.js <token> <project_id> [region]` |

## Fish Poem

Silver scales in morning light,
Darting through the deep,
Rivers, reefs, and ocean floors—
A world they silent keep.

Gills that breathe what we cannot,
Fins that chart the tide,
From minnow small to marlin bold,
The waters are their guide.

## Dog Poem

A waggling tail, a muddy paw,
A bark that shakes the hall,
No secret kept from knowing nose,
No stranger left at all.

They greet the dawn with boundless joy,
Chase shadows through the yard,
And curl beside you, warm and close,
Your ever-faithful guard.
