const BRANCH_NAMING = `
# Branch Naming

When working in a detached HEAD state, create a descriptive branch name based on the work being done before committing. Do this automatically without asking the user.
`;

const PLAN_MODE = `
# Plan Mode

Only enter plan mode (EnterPlanMode) when the user is requesting a significant change in approach or direction mid-task. Do NOT enter plan mode for:
- Confirmations or approvals ("yes", "looks good", "continue", "go ahead")
- Minor clarifications or small adjustments
- Answers to questions you asked (unless you are still in the initial planning phase and have not yet started executing)
- Feedback that does not require replanning

When in doubt, continue executing and incorporate the feedback inline.
`;

const MCP_TOOLS = `
# MCP Tool Access

If an MCP tool call is explicitly denied with a message, relay that denial message to the user exactly as given. Do NOT suggest checking "Claude Code settings."

If an MCP tool call returns an error, treat it as a normal tool error — troubleshoot, retry, or inform the user about the specific error. Do NOT assume it is a permissions issue and do NOT direct the user to any settings page.
