# Releasing Updates

PostHog Code uses semantic versioning with git tags. Patch versions are automatically computed from commit counts.

The version in `apps/code/package.json` is set to `0.0.0-dev` - this is intentional. CI injects the real version at build time from git tags.

## Version Format: `major.minor.patch`

- **major.minor**: Controlled by git tags (e.g., `v0.15.0`, `v1.0.0`)
- **patch**: Auto-calculated as number of commits since the minor tag

**Important:** Releases must use proper three-part semver versions (e.g., `v0.22.1`, not `v0.22`). The Electron auto-updater uses update.electronjs.org, which requires valid semver for version comparison. Two-part versions will break auto-updates.

## How It Works

1. A base tag like `v0.15.0` marks the start of a minor version
2. Each push to `main` triggers a release with version `0.15.N` where N = commits since `v0.15.0`
3. No manual `package.json` updates needed for patch releases

## Releasing a Patch (Automatic)

Just push to `main`. The workflow computes the version automatically:

```
v0.15.0 tag exists
Push commit #1 → releases 0.15.1
Push commit #2 → releases 0.15.2
Push commit #3 → releases 0.15.3
```

## Releasing a Minor Version

Create a new base tag when you want to bump the minor version:

```bash
git tag v0.16.0
git push origin v0.16.0
```

The next push to `main` will release `0.16.1`.

## Releasing a Major Version

Same process, just increment the major:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Checking Current Version

See what version would be released:

```bash
# Find the current base tag
git tag --list 'v[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*' --sort=-v:refname | grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.0$' | head -1

# Count commits since base tag (this is the patch number)
git rev-list v0.15.0..HEAD --count
```

## Tag Naming Convention

- **Base tags** (manual): `vX.Y.0` - e.g., `v0.15.0`, `v1.0.0`
- **Release tags** (auto): `vX.Y.Z` - e.g., `v0.15.3`, created by CI

Only base tags (`vX.Y.0`) are used for version calculation. Release tags (`vX.Y.Z`) are created for GitHub releases but ignored when computing the next version.
